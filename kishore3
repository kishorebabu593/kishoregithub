GIT is a version control tool
it is used to store the codes 
repositry is a collection of files or folders
it has two types:

1. Centralized version control
2. Distributed centralized version control

centralized version control:

it is the old model version control
it is a failure because of its single remote repositry model
it takes so much time to download and upload the programming codes


Distributed centralized version control:

It is a current working model in market
unlike CVC it has local repositry on each systems and it has remote version contontrol(GitHub).
it takes a fraction of second to download and upload files or folders.
